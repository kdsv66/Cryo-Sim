# Cryo-Sim
Cryo-SIM converts molecular dynamics data—number density and dipole potentials—into synthetic cryo-EM images of liposomes. Users can customize voltage, defocus, resolution, and noise to mimic real microscopy. It outputs noisy and noise-free images plus radial profiles, helping researchers validate simulations against experimental data.
